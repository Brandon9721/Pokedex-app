# Pokedex-app
app made while following along in online udemy course for iOS10 and swift 3 development. Will be a pokedex that grabs info off of the pokemon API website to put into app. 
API used in app found here: https://pokeapi.co/  

# Work in progress:   
So far music plays in background which can be muted at any time and resumed.  
You can scroll down through 700+ Pokemon (Doesn't have the newest ones up to the 800th pokemon as of this writing.)  
Click on one of the collection views and it will display information for the chosen Pokemon.  
 
Still need to add functionality of downloading JSON data of each pokemons move list and also display proper evolution tree. Currently when a pokemon is selected the section that shows the next evolution defaults to Venusaur as shown in an image below. When finished it will display proper image for next evolution
